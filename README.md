This is a basic library manager I coded during my time at the Powers Art Center in Summer 2021. 

The program reads a .csv file for its input, and then uses c++ iostream to allow the user to make changes to the file,
and writes those changes back into the spreadsheet.

For confidentiality reasons, the spreadsheet source and any identifying information have been omitted.
