This is a basic library manager I coded during my time at the Powers Art Center in Summer 2021. 

The program reads a .csv file for its input, and then uses c++ iostream to allow the user to make changes to the database.

For confidentiality reasons, the spreadsheet source and any identifying information have been omitted.
